Raspberry Pi Debugger
=====================

This repository houses hardware debugging tools for Raspberry Pi. The design should be usable with the full range of Pi 0, 1, 1+, 2 by breaking away the top section of the board when used with a Pi 1.

The FT2232H dual port USB interface can be used to access JTAG and UART at the same time.
